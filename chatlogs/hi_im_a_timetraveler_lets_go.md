> You're back, you know. It's like we've never been gone...
I wonder what he will say when we see him in person again.
The message reads: "Hello, I am from the future. We need to talk."
What does this mean? How could they be talking to us right now? Are we supposed to believe in a time machine?
We look at each other in confusion. "Who do you think it is?" one of us says.
"I don't know, but I have a feeling that we're the reason why they're here," Stan replies.
Suddenly, we hear footsteps approaching from behind. We turn around to see a man standing before us, holding what looks like a time-traveling device in his hands.
"Greetings, travelers," he says with a smile. "I am Professor Williams. I have been sent back in time to speak with you."
The three of us exchange nervous glances. We're not sure if we can trust him.
"Please," Stan says, "we don't know what this is all about. Can you explain?"
Professor Williams nods and begins to speak. "You see, I have been tasked with studying the impact that time travel has on the course of history. I need your help in gathering data."
We look at each other again, unsure if we want to get involved. But something tells us that this is important, and we know that we can't turn our backs now.
"Okay," Stan says finally. "What do you need from us?"
The professor smiles again. "I need three people to travel back in time with me to different moments in history. You will each be assigned a specific event to study."
We nod, still unsure of what this all means. But something deep inside us knows that we have to go through with it.
"So," the professor says, "are you ready?"
Stan nods and takes a step forward. He is nervous but excited about this new adventure. The other two follow suit, and together they walk into the unknown.
