And now, please consider some of the questions posed below:
1) What is time really?
2) Is there no time without our mind?
3) Can we know what happens in the future with certainty?
4) If not, how can one predict an event or a future outcome that has yet to happen? (I.e. is it even possible?)
5) How does the concept of time relate to causality and its effects?
6) What about the \"flow\" of time; is there any such thing as this and if so, how can one actually observe or describe its properties?
7) Can we know what happens in a past that has already happened? (I.e. is it even possible?)
8) If not, how does this relate to the concept of causality and its effects?
9) What about the \"flow\" of time; is there any such thing as this and if so, how can one actually observe or describe its properties?
10) Are we free from the limitations imposed upon us by the passing of time? If not, what are these limitations?
11) Can we know what will happen in the future with certainty? (I.e. is it even possible?)
12) How does this relate to causality and its effects?

18) How does this relate to causality and its effects?
19) Is there such a thing as free will and if so, can we use it to change the course of time?
20) What are some of the ways in which one could potentially alter or manipulate the flow of time?
21) Is there any truth to the idea that time travel is possible? (I.e. is it even possible?)
22) If so, what would be the most effective way to do this?
23) Can we use our understanding of causality to predict and control events that are yet to happen? (I.e. is it even possible?)
24) How does this relate to free will?
25) Is there such a thing as free will and if so, can one use it to change the course of time?
26) What are some of the ways in which one could potentially alter or manipulate the flow of time?
27) Are there any ethical considerations that need to be taken into account when attempting to alter or manipulate the flow of time?
28) Is there such a thing as free will and if so, can one use it to change the course of time? (I.e. is it even possible?)
29) What are some of the ways in which one could potentially alter or manipulate the flow of time? (I.e. should we?)
30) Are there any ethical considerations that need to be taken into account when attempting to alter or manipulate the flow of time? (I.e. how would this impact other people's lives?)
