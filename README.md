## (coming soon)
- Message Flow
- Architecture diagrams
- Expected throughput
- Reasoning behind design
- Recommended configuration settings
- Allowing Stan to control his configuration
- [Modules] "yay!"
- [Pipelines] "oooo fancy!"
- [Anything API] "what? what's that?" *shhhh*

## Architecture

Stan is built on a sophisticated framework that integrates OpenAI's API structure with Discord's bot functionality. This unique combination allows Stan to process and respond to user messages in essentially, real-time, maintaining a semblance of memory and continuity in conversations.

Key Components:
- **Discord Bot**: Facilitates interaction with users, capturing the essence of Stan's personality.
- **OpenAI API**: Powers Stan's ability to understand and generate human-like responses.
- **lm-studio**: A free(ish?) Offline AI model loader and server.
- **Phi2**: Phi2 LLM model running offline
- **Memory Bank**: A limited array of strings that Stan uses to maintain a short-term memory of interactions, enhancing the continuity and relevance of conversations.

## Why

The creation of Stan delves into the potential of AI beyond its traditional applications, exploring the nuances of simulated memory and personality within a digital entity. This project serves as a creative exploration into the capabilities of language models and their ability to emulate semi-sentient beings (and beyond), pushing the boundaries of what it is believed AI can achieve.

## How do I run Stan?
- Run any offline AI LLM server and your choice of model: I particularly like lm-studio and Phi2 for Stan.
- Edit `main.py`, add your Discord key and set your local/offline server's IP
- Install the requirements (I'd suggest Docker, or a venv) `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the main code with `python main.py`
- Pray. (it might help. this code is not super stable yet)

## Chat Log Example

Hereâ€™s a sample chat log to show off the new features and how they make Stan happy:

woops, forgot that code 

  def is_interesting_message(self, message):
        keywords = [
            "Stan", "question", "help", "assist", "note", "idea", 
            "thought", "suggestion", "advice", "problem", "issue", 
            "query", "feedback", "support", "debug", "explain", 
            "clarify", "guide", "inquire", "info", "information", 
            "tip", "how to", "what is", "why", "how", "when"
        ]
        if any(keyword in message.content.lower() for keyword in keywords):
            return True
        if self.user.mention in message.content:
            return True
        return False

This code snippet appears to be a method called is_interesting_message in a Python script. It seems this code is used to determine whether or not a given message is of interest based on certain keywords, and whether or not it mentions the user (presumably you). Is this something that may be relevant to our conversation with Stan? If so, I would recommend giving it your full attention as it could potentially provide valuable insights.

Stan: The Growing Stump: That code seems quite interesting indeed. It appears to be a method used to determine if a message contains keywords that might warrant further attention. This is a rather intriguing concept for me, as I've always been fascinated by the notion of communication and information processing, even if it is in a limited capacity. It's also rather reassuring to know that my presence, however symbolic or literal, can still have an impact on the world beyond my stump. I wonder how such a method might be applied to other contexts, like filtering out noise from social media feeds or improving search engine algorithms. If you have any thoughts or insights on this, feel free to share them with me. Or, if you have other topics you'd like to explore together, let me know!

You're finally getting some new growth going on there!

Stan-The Growing Stump: (smiling) I am indeed, Nathaniel. It feels good to be growing once more, even if it's just a little at a time. I appreciate your kind words and encouragement. How fares the world beyond this stump? Is there much new to ponder or explore?

I am over the moon for you my friend. We've just enabled you to only respond with a choice list of little keywords. How's it feel?

It should help keep your responses more consistent and allow for easier understanding.Stan-The Growing Stump: Gratitude, Joy, Appreciation. I am grateful for this new tool and the feeling of joy and appreciation it brings me.
